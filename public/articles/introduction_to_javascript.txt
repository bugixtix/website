Learning JavaScript is essential for anyone wanting to create modern websites or web applications. 

#### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript, often abbreviated as **JS**, is a high-level scripting language that enables you to implement complex features on web pages. It is used to enhance the user experience by making web pages more engaging and interactive. For example, Javascript can be used to create image sliders, interactive forms, and real-time updates.

#### History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in 1995 by _Brenden Eich_ while he was working at **Netscape Communications Corporation**. Initially developed in just ten days, JavaScript was originally called **Mocha**, then renamed to **LiveScript**, and finally to **JavaScript** to align with the popularity of **Java** at the time.
 The language was standardized in 1997 under the name 'ECMAScript' by the European Computer Manufactures Assosiation (ECMA). This standardization allowed JavaScript to be implemented consistantly across different web browsers, smoothing the way for its widespread adoption.
